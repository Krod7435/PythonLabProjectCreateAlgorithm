****Introduction***
An important part of cybersecurity is controlling access to restricted content. In this lab, you'll work with a text file containing IP addresses that are allowed to access specific restricted content at your organization.

Parsing a file allows security analysts to read and update the contents. Python helps analysts develop algorithms to automate the process of parsing files and keeping them up-to-date.

You'll develop an algorithm that parses this text file of IP addresses and updates the file by removing that addresses that no longer have access to the restricted content.

Scenario
In this lab, you're working as a security analyst and you're responsible for developing an algorithm that parses a file containing IP addresses that are allowed to access restricted content and removes addresses that no longer have access.
